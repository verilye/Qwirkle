Assignment 2 - Advanced Programming Techniques

Object of the Game
Create and expand lines of color and shape strategically in order to score the most points.

Each player draws 6 tiles and places them that no other player can see them. This is your deck.

Find the player with the most tiles sharing one characteristic. That player plays those tiles in a row or column and the number of tiles is the score for that first turn.

Game Play
On your turn you can do one of the 3 actions:

Add one tile to the grid and draw a tile to bring your deck again to 6.
Add two or more tiles to the grid.
All tiles played must share one attribute (color or shape) and must be placed in the same line.

The tiles must not all have to touch each other.

Again, draw tiles until your deck has 6 tiles again.

Trade some or all of your tiles for different tiles.

The main issue of our delay is the differing results we are getting from each of our members.
Issues ranging from compiling to different errors that we are seeing, even despite pulling from the same main branch
is significantly delaying our assignment submission.

We believe all the core functions have been coded but something is missing when putting it alltogether which is causing
a whole range of mistakes such as segmentation errors, outright crashes and merge conflicts when pushing to Github.

Constanza: I could never run the program properly, even though all my classmates could, so I depended on them to test my code.
